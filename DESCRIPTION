Description: Flexibly implements Integral Projection Models using a
  mathematical(ish) syntax. This package will not help with the vital rate
  modeling process, but will help convert those regression models into an
  IPM. 'ipmr' handles density dependence and environmental stochasticity, with a
  couple of options for implementing the latter. In addition, provides functions
  to avoid unintentional eviction of individuals from models. Additionally, 
  provides model diagnostic tools, plotting functionality, 
  stochastic/deterministic simulations, and analysis tools.
  Integral projection models are described in depth by Easterling et al. (2000)

  Williams et al. (2012) <doi:10.1890/11-2147.1> discuss the problem of 
  unintentional eviction.
